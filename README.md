# 🎬 MovieShop

**MovieShop** is a personal pet project — a simple console-based movie disc shop application written in **C/C++**.  
The program allows users to **search**, **sort**, and **view** movies with details such as title, director, genre, rating, and disk price.  
It features a retro **ASCII art interface** for a fun visual experience in the terminal.
